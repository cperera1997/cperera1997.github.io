         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Safe Sport was a mobile application and check-in kiosk interface I designed with three other students in Figma as an academic project. We thought of the concept during the beginning of
            the Covid-19 pandemic where Vancouver residents weren't given the opportunity to use outdoor facitilies due to the risk of spreading the virus in close spaces.
            The goal of our whole interface was to allow residents in the city of Vancouver to be able to reserve times to use public outdoor acitivity spaces during the 
            pandemic. We designed the mobile application to allow users the chance to search through available outdoor facitilies in the city of Vancouver such as basketball and tennis 
            courts, then book a time and set the number of people that will be in your reservation to stay within Covid-19 gathering guidelines. We then created a kiosk check-in system concept
            to be placed in each outdoor facility to ensure that residents that booked the time slot to use an outdoor facility gets access
            to it while still following Covid-19 protocols. </p>

    <p>The team and I first started the project by creating journey map frameworks of how a Vancouver resident would possibly use the system to book an outdoor facility such as 
       a tennis court. We made our journey map outline how a Vancouver resident would go about wanting to use an outdoor tennis court in Vancouver, then taking the appropriate
       steps to book a reservation at the facility, arrriving and checking in to the facility, then using the time that had been reserved while still adhering to Covid-19 
       guidelines.

    <p>Once that framework was laid out we started the Wireframes for each part of the system was designed which was the kiosk and mobile application. We designed the mobile app layout
      to allow users to search outdoor sports facilities based on sport or location. I also made the mobile app provide different information about the city such as the weather or
     how far different outdoor facilities were away from a their location. I also wored on the kiosk interface that was designed to allow users to book reservation times to use the outdoor facility
     by drop in, or use the mobile app to check-in to the kiosk to use the space.

         <h3>UI Research and Testing</h3>

         <figcaption>Information/Feedback Provide by User Testing</figcaption>
         <p>Once we completed the application and kiosk interface, we conducted UI tests with participants to get feedback on the overall layout and flow off the applications. 
            From these tests and feedback changes we were able to make the interface a lot more smooth and streamline. The changes I focused on included updates to the interface to make
            booking outdoor sports spaces more understandable and making the check-in with the kiosk easier to follow.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <main class='main'>

         <section class='left section'>
       
            <p class="marginfix"> The main challenge I faced when creating the interactive interface was using Figma's prototyping tool. This was my first time working with this tool provided by Figma. It allows users to link different 
               page elements to other elements on other pages to create an interface that had buttons and pages that could be interacted with in a presentation mode. The main challenge I faced was with
               creating an interface this way, many connections between elements had to be made to make the interface interactive. The image shows all the connections that were made between
               each page on the mobile application to show the scope of how many connections had to be made. It was a very time consuming procedure but produced a functioning interactive prototype.

      <h2>Final Product</h2>
        <p> Overall this project provided me with insight on how to develop user interfaces and how to test them with participants in order to get feedback, and improve on the overall design.
           If we had more time to work on the interface more detail would've gone into making sure the entire application was interactive. However due to the number of connections
           between elements that had already been made, for the purpose of prototyping we only partially completed the interactive parts of the application. Below provides access to both the kiosk and mobile application
           interface for users to interact with.
