         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Safe Sport was a mobile application and check-in kiosk interface designed in Figma as an academic project. The concept was thought of during the beginning of
            the Covid-19 pandemic where Vancouver residents weren't given the opportunity to use outdoor facitilies due to the risk of spreading the virus in close spaces.
            The goal of the whole interface was to allow residents in the city of Vancouver to be able to reserve times to use public outdoor acitivity spaces during the 
            pandemic. The mobile application allowed users the chance to search through available outdoor facitilies in the city of Vancouver such as basketball and tennis 
            courts, then book a time and set the number of people that will be in your reservation to stay within Covid-19 gathering guidelines. A kiosk check-in system concept
            was thought of to be placed in each outdoor facility to ensure that residents that booked the time slot to use an outdoor facility gets access
            to it in whille following Covid-19 covid protocols. </p>

    <p>The first thing that was done was creating journey map frameworks of how a Vancouver resident would possibly use the system to book an outdoor facility such as 
       a tennis court. The jouney map outlined how a Vancouver resident would go about wanting to use an outdoor tennis court in Vancouver, then taking the appropriate
       steps to book a reservation at the facility, arrriving and checking in to the facility, theen using the time that had been reserved while still adhering to Covid-19 
       guidelines.

    <figcaption>Wireframe of Mobile app and Kiosk Interface </figcaption>


    <p>Once that framework was laid out the Wireframe for each part of the system was designed which was the kiosk and mobile application. The mobile app layout
      was designed to allow users to search outdoor sports facilities based on sport or location. The app also gave different information about the city such as the weather or
     how far different outdoor facilities were away from a user's location. The kiosk interface was then designed to allow users to book reservation times to use the outdoor facility
     by drop in, or use the mobile app to check-in to the kiosk to use the space.

         <h3>UI Research and Testing</h3>

         <figcaption>Information/Feedback Provide by User Testing</figcaption>
         <p>Once the application and kiosk interface was completed, UI tests were done with participants to get feedback on the overall layout and flow off the applications. 
            From these tests and feedback changes were able to be made to make the interface a lot more smooth and streamline. These changes included updates to the interface to make
            booking outdoor sports spaces more understandable and making the check-in with the kiosk easier to understand.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <main class='main'>

         <section class='left section'>
       
            <p class="marginfix"> The main challenge was creating an interactive interface using Figma's prototyping tool. This tool provided by Figma allows users to link different page elements to others
               elements on other pages which allowed us to create an interface that had buttons and pages that could be interacted with in a prsentation mode. The main challenge was with
               creating an interface this way, many connections between elements had to be made to have an interactive interface. The image shows all the connections that were made between
               each page on the mobile application to show the scope of how many connections had to be made. It was a very time consuming procedure but produced a good interactive prototype.

      <h2>Final Product</h2>
        <p> Overall this project provided insight on how to develop user interfaces and how to test them with participants in order to get feedback and improve on the overall design.
           If more time was given to work on the interface more detail would've gone into making sure the entire application was interactive. However due to the number of connections
           between elements that had already been made, for the purpose of prototyping the application was partially complete. Below provides access to both the kiosk and mobile application
           interface for users to interact with.
