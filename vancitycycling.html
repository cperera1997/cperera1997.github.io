         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>VanCity Cycling is a mobile application for Android that allows novice cyclist to travel around the city of Vancouver. This was an academic project that 
            was completed in a two-person team where the goal was to encourage more Vancouverites to use cycling as an alternative mode of transportation. The app 
            features many tools that would make the cycling experience for novice cyclist as safe and as comfortable as possible. With Vancity Cycling users have the ability
            to plan out the their cycling trips around the city of Vancouver and provides information that can help them get on the right track when beginning their cycling
            experience. After 8 weeks of buiding and refining this application we were given the opportunity to present Vancity Cyclying to the city of Vancouver's Transportation
            Division where we gave a demonstration of a walkthough of the app.</p>

    <h2>Wireframe and Interface Design</h2>
         <p>The first part of the project consisted of interface layout, feature ideation, colour layout and overall design of the app. I worked on  
            the interface designs of each possible page we could implement through Figma, such as the main map screen or the account login page. While designing 
            the interface, I also helped brainstorm different features that could be implemented, as well as look for different colour palettes to style the app. 
            Ultimately the team chose to go with the city of Vancouver colour palette to match the city the app was being used in.
            Once the entire interface was designed on Figma I then coded layout in Android Studios using XML.

            <h2>Application Features</h2>
            <p> The main functionality of the app was to provide a map and a route for cyclist to follow, so we made the map of the city the
                central focus of the homepage with the options to set your route based off of user search entry or by selecting landmarks in the application's database. 
                I also implemented checklist feature which gave the users the ability to create checklist that allowed them to create detailed list of what they needed to help them prepare 
                for their trips. Users can also edit and update these lists as well as delete certain tasks in a checklist or the whole checklist itself.

            </p>
           
         
              <h3>Database & User Preferences</h3>
              <main class='main'>

               <section class='left section'>
             
                 <p>We created the database using SQLite which was able to store user information such as account information (first & last name, username, password,etc.) as 
                    well as the ability to store favourite cycling routes. I also set the database to store checklist data so that each user of the app have their own checklists stored. The 
                    database also contained all the bike routes in Vancouver and had data to predetermined routes that users have a choice to choose from. Lastly, we setup the database
                    of the application to store user setting such as setting and saving light or dark mode for the user interface.

            <h3>Map Functionality</h3>
            

            <div class="container">
               <div class="category">
                  <img src="img/vancitylandmarks.PNG" alt="poop" class="imgwidth2" >
                <img src="img/vancitypopularroutes.PNG" alt="poop" class="imgwidth2" >
                <img src="img/vancitypopularroutes.PNG" alt="poop"class="imgwidth2" ></div>
           </div>
           <figcaption class="figcap2">Landmarks, Popular Routes, and Create Route Interface</figcaption>
           <p>
            In the map section of the application we decided to give users the option of creating their cycling route by either creating their own route, selecting from their most popular routes, 
            or selecting a route to a landmark in Vancouver. In the create route section, we give users the ability to choose their start and end points by searching each point. 
            We set up the application look through the database to see if there are available routes to the selected points and then display whichever routes for the user to choose from. 
            I also provided the user with detailed information about their selected route such as the route number, route distance, duration and bikeways type. Once the route is selected an 
            outline of the trip will appear on the map and will adjust according to the user’s position. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            The next way we decided to let users create a cycling route was by using the popular routes section. In this section I helped connect the app 
            to a database of different predetermined routes that users will have access to cycle on. We enabled these routes to be filtered to help users find the routes 
            that they are most comfortable with. Users can then favourite these routes which we then stored in the SQL database where users will
            be able to save and have access to if they want to cycle that particular route again.
            </p>
            <br>
             <p>
            Lastly we made a landmarks page with different popular landmarks across Vancouver that could be visited by cycling. I researched different landmarks 
            around Vancouver then populated a database with those destinations. I then designed the section to display the landmarks in a list form and when the user
            select the landmark they want to visit, the app would then create a route for them using Directions API from their current location to the landmark.
            
           </p>

            <h3>Sensor Data & Extra Features</h3>
            <main class='main'>

               <section class='left section'>
             
                 <p>We also had the app take advantage of the GPS information as well as data provided by the sensors in android devices that would benefit a cycist while on their trip. 
                  I used a GPS to determine where the user is and then gets the current temperature for the user. We also implemented a feature were if the temperature goes below 7ºC or above 18ºC and the 
                   user plans to start a trip they will be alerted of weather it is hot or cold outside and will be reccomended to plan for their trip accordingly. I was also able to use the GPS 
                   to track the users current location so as they are cycling, their speed is displayed on resource page and will adjust accordingly.  
                   </p>
                  <br>
                   <p>
                   I also took advantage of the data provided by a devices air pressure sensors to let users know if they are experiencing a more challenging part of their trip. If the sensor reads that air
                   pressure is increasing then that means the cyclist is on an incline. To complete the resources page, I provided users with links to bike laws in Vancouver, gerenal cycling safety, 
                   and access to the city of Vancouver website where they can learn more about the city they are cycling in.   </p>

             </main>
            <p > The last feature that I implemented was the ability for users to switch between light and dark mode. This was a user preference setting that users could toggle
               and could be saved based on the user's account.  </p>

           <h2 >Final Product</h2>
           <p> The video below is an overview and walk through of the application and it's features. For future development of Vancity Cyclying, we had the idea of a rating system for 
              the routes but due to deadline constraints we left it out of the presented app. Throughout the 8 weeks working on the projects I've developed a comfotable
            understanding of designing and creating mobile applications such as using XML for front-end mobile application design and Java, JSON, and web APIs for backend mobile application
            development. Our group was lucky enough after presenting this to our peers to get the opporutnity by City of Vancouver to present a demonstration of the 
            VanCity Cycling to the transportation division of work done by bundergraduate students.
