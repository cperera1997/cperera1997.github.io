            This was a project where I designed original artwork for a client who is a musician. They made a song called Chanel and they needed a song cover designed to put on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.

            I first started the project by listening to the song and creating a possible list of ideas or keywords when listening to the song. After listening to the song a few times I listed every word I thought I could use as a theme for my design. I focused on three words that were used in the song and then I started sketching possible ideas for the song cover. Next I brought my sketched out ideas to Photoshop and Illustrator and began designing the covers. After I created three that I finished designing I sent them to my client so that they could see which one they liked more and then we further went into detail on what could be touched up for the one they liked. I then worked on the design for a couple more days and completed the design to their specification.

            One main problem I ran into when designing this for my client was putting aside personal preferences while showing my original ideation to my client. I personally preferred my previous iterations of the cover art but the client insisted on adding some extra pieces to my original design. Understanding that I shouldnâ€™t let my own personal opinion get in the way of a client's vision,I designed it as best I could while trying to make the cover art something I could be proud of.
